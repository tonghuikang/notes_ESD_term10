> When submitting the report, please also upload a zipped folder containing the code you developed. 
> All dependencies and files needed to run your code must be available and listed in a readme file. 
> Very important: Your code must produce the same results as you uploaded on Kaggle.



# List of dependencies

And the explaination of its usage

library(tictoc) # for measuring time 

library(plyr) # to manipulate datafrme

library(dplyr) # to manipulate dataframe

library(stringr) # to extract features from tweets

library(rebus.base) # to count repeated vowels

library(tm) # text mining package (from the course)

library(SnowballC) # to construct the DTM (from the course)

library(randomForest) # the model (from the course)



# List of files

`test.csv`
`train.csv`

(in the same directory)



# Proof of results

The .R file is available in the folder. It has been converted from .ipynb which is downloaded from the Kaggle. A .html file is provided for immediate viewing.



Our final model will be made available here.
