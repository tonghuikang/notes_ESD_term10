This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Simple functions

Basic array functions

```{r}
arr <- c(1,3,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,8,2)

max(arr)
min(arr)

which.max(arr)
which(arr == max(arr)) 
# return positions of the array that is the maximum
```


Parallel comparisons

```{r}
arz <- c(5,6,7,8,1,5,2,4,6,8,9)

pmax(arr,arz)
```


Summary functions

```{r}
sum(arr)
prod(arr)
var(arr)
sd(arr)
exp(arr)
summary(arr)
```

Remove all variables from the workspace

```{r}
ls()
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```

Differences in the assignment using <- and ==. 

```{r}
exp(a<-1:5)
```

Generating vectors using varienty of commands

```{r}
x <- -4:4
x
x <- seq(-4,4,1)
x

# repeating 
rep(x, times=2)
rep(x, each=3)
```

Returns logical vector based on check

```{r}
x
x > 1
```

Dealing with missing entries

```{r}
?is.na
```
