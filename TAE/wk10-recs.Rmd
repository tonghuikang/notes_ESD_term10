# Script for Week 10 -- session 1 (in-class activity)


######## Set the working environemnt and Load the data


```{r}
# Load the MovieLens datasets
movies <- read.csv("wk10-movies.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# With the option stringsAsFactors=FALSE we make sure that character vectors are 
# not converted into factors.
str(movies) # The dataframe consists of two variables with 8569 movies with movieID and title
head(movies) # First part of the dataframe
summary(movies) # Summary of the data

# To read in the movie genres, we use the following commands 
# This helps count the number of fields separated by "|" in each row of genres.csv
countfields <- count.fields("genres.csv", sep="|") 
countfields[1] # The first movie, for example has 5 genres listed
# With this command, we can see that movies have from 1 to 7 genres listed
min(countfields)
max(countfields)

# Now, we load genres.csv. The command creates a dataframe with 8569 observations 
# and 7 variables with column names X1 ... X7.
genres <- read.csv("genres.csv", header=FALSE, sep="|", col.names=c("X1","X2","X3","X4","X5","X6","X7"))
#
# Note that each variable has different number of levels. 
str(genres) 

# We want to work with a matrix having 8,569 rows and a number of columns equal to the number of genres.
# For each cell, we want to know whether a certain genre is associated (1) or not (0) to a certain movie.
# This requires some processing of the data contained in 'genres'. We use a dedicated function to do it.
#
# Back to the code folder
setwd(".../R code")
#
# Source and run the function
source('process_genre_data.R')
M <- process_genre_data(genres)

# Last step, we create a dataframe (named "Data") with movie title and classification
Data <- as.data.frame(M)
Data$title <- movies$title
Data <- Data[,-19] # Drops the 19th column, which corresponds to the "" category


######## Hierarchical clustering

# With the function dist, we calculate the distance 
# between movies using the first 19 columns (genres of movies)
distances <- dist(Data[,1:19], method="euclidean")
dim(Data)
# Note that we computed 8569*8568/2 distances
length(distances)

# Execute hierarchical clustering. We use Ward's distance method to find compact clusters.
clusterMovies1 <- hclust(distances, method="ward.D2")
# Plots the dendrogram. We have several movies, so the lists at the bottom cannot be read
plot(clusterMovies1) 

# Let's then cut the dendrogram into 10 clusters
clusterGroups1 <- cutree(...)
# Compute the average value across the clusters for the Action variable. 
# Higher value indicates many movies in the cluster are action movies.
tapply(...) 

# Create a matrix "Cat1" where rows denote categories and columns indicate clusters
Cat1 <- matrix(0,nrow=19,ncol=10)
for(i in 1:19)
{Cat1[i,] <- tapply(Data[,i], clusterGroups1, mean)}
rownames(Cat1) <- colnames(Data)[1:19]
Cat1

# Let's take a look at various movies
subset(Data$title, clusterGroups1==6)
subset(Data, movies$title=="Grand Budapest Hotel, The (2014)")
clusterGroups1[8418]
subset(Data, movies$title=="Moneyball (2011)")
clusterGroups1[7925]
subset(Data, movies$title=="X-Men: First Class (2011)")
clusterGroups1[7849]


######## K-means clustering

set.seed(1)
# This performs a K-means clustering using k=10 and 20 random initial configurations
# (a random set of rows is chosen as initial centers)
clusterMovies2 <- kmeans(..)
# Total within cluster sum of squares (we want this number to be small)
clusterMovies2$tot.withinss # 7324.78
#
# Let's try again, but, this time, with just one initial configuration
set.seed(1)
clusterMovies3 <- kmeans(..)
clusterMovies3$tot.withinss # 7601.802
# We can see that picking more starting point is useful!

# Let's now vary the value of k and plot the error in the cluster as a function of k
set.seed(1)
fit <- 0
for(k in 1:15)
{clusterMovies4 <- kmeans(Data[,1:19], centers=k, nstart=20)
fit[k] <- clusterMovies4$tot.withinss}
plot(1:15,fit)

# Let's see the corresponding clusters
Cat2 <- matrix(0,nrow=19,ncol=10)
for(i in 1:19)
{Cat2[i,] <- tapply(Data[,i], clusterMovies2$cluster, mean)}
rownames(Cat2) <- colnames(Data)[1:19]
Cat2
```
