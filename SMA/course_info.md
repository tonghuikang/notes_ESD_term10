- Online submission of completed tutorials and activities (10%) 
- Project proposal – due in week 6 (3%) 
- Course feedback survey (2%) 



Project (35%) 

- Develop depth in one methodology (system dynamics, discrete event simulation/ process simulation, agent-based modeling) using a project
- Due in week 12
- Team-based: 1 to 4-person teams of your choosing
- Flexible grading: negotiate score weights with instructor



## Project guidelines

Default score is 8/10 for each component.
