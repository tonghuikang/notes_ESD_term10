In the ESD Summer Newsletter 2019

> Simulation Modeling and Analysis is a new core T6 course introduced in Fall 2018.
> It builds on but replaces the previous half-semester course in simulation analysis by adding a half-semester focus on different simulation modeling approaches: system dynamics, agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, process simulation, and physics-based simulation. 
> The course features a student-initiated project which must use one of the modeling approaches and apply statistical techniques to rank at least two different system designs. 
> There was exciting variety and complexity in the projects students designed. 
> **Students in Capstone have expressed appreciation that they learned javascript as part of this course.**
> Javascript is a browser-friendly scripting language with a host of useful libraries.


### My development environmnent

The most baseline method of development is edit on a text file and then to `console.log()` and then restart the browser every time you edit your code.

This is inefficient because
- It is difficult to track variables.
  - You need to stop write `console.log()` and restart when you want to track new variables.
  - You do not know which variables are you tracking (what was printed?).
  - Too many values is being printed and you need to remove variables from your logs.
- You do not know if your syntax is correct.
- You cannot track your edits.

The next most baseline method is to edit your code on Google Chrome.
- You have access to breakpoints. 
  - You can view the variables and its values when you hit the breakpoint.


**This is my development environment**

- VSCode to edit the code
  - It offers syntax highlighting.
- VSCode Extension Debugger for Chrome by Mircosoft
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome
- Google Chrome
  - There should be no additional configurations.
