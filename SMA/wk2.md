Elements of InsightMaker

- Stocks are the blue rectangles. You need to define an intial value.
- Flows are variables that affect changes in the stock.
- Variables are orange circles. They defined with a constant or a variable (does not have intial value).
- Converter is considered a variable. It takes one input and goes through a map defined with interpolated data points. Elements taking the converter as input will use the output value.
- Then you can add images to for decoration (for example to illustrate a reinforcing or balancing loop).

This was how Forrester show counterintitive results to city planners of the time.

> Our simulation reproduces the observations made by Forrester in 1969. 
> In the early years construction in the city is booming, so employment is on the increase and population increases exponentially. 
> As growth continues, availability of land grows scarce. The cityâ€™s attractiveness decreases and construction slows down. Unemployment rises. 
> As businesses disappear, building maintenance declines, which leads to abandoned buildings and decrease in the population

Some important indicators should ideally be equal to **one**. For example
- Labor Force to Job Ratio
- Land Fraction Occupied
- Households to housing Ratio


Use the indicators to illustrate and predict problems like
- lack of jobs
- almost all land is occupied
- too many houses


Then policies could be implemented. For example
- Increase birth rate through birth incentives
- Provide low cost housing to increase population
- Give incentives to the construction of more business structures
- Control Immigration (build a wall)
- Encourage urban regeneration

A controversial conclusion in Urban Dynamics was that the most commonly-accepted plans for improving an urban area could actually be inefficient and potentially harmful for the city.

- Financial aid, low-cost housing and government jobs programs
They could lead to other problems such as overpopulation and unemployment.

Urban renewal policies were found to be very effective as they shift the bias away from non-job-generating structures (e.g., housing) to job-generating structures.
