# SUTD ESD Term 4+6=10 notes

For some reason, I am taking SUTD ESD Term 4 modules 

- [40.002 Optimisation](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40002-optimisation/)
- [40.011 Data and Business Analytics](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40011-data-business-analytics/)

and Term 6 modules together

- [40.015 Simulation Modelling and Analysis](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40015-simulation-modelling-analysis/)
- [40.016 The Analytics Edge](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40016-the-analytics-edge/)

plus the SUTD Entrepreneurship module.

- [30.111 Entrepreneurship](https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate-courses/30111-entrepreneurship/)

This is how the file system currently looks like. Each folder at root is an acronym of the **subject** (for my ease of file navigation). 

Then each folder contains **markdown files**, and most of its content is accesible with Github bulit-in Markdown viewer. The markdown files are usually named with week number and topic.

Inside each subject folder, there is an **assets folder**. This will contain the screenshots of the slides that I have taken, usually from the instructor's slides.

However, many of the files contain **LaTeX** for mathematicial expressions, which is not parse by Github. To view the entire content if necessary, please download/clone a copy and use Typora. (I recommendations on how to read LaTeX without downloading anything, while being able to navigate across files).

There might be submodules some subject folders. This is where I house my personal information or group project information. Please alert me if you are somehow able to access them.

**Why do I want to do this?**

I hope my seniors have done something like this, even though I will want to make my own notes no matter how similar is theirs are. It is nice to have a reference as well.

I can also show to my future employers and my future partner that I am a diligent student.
