# Guest lectures

Today there is a series of guest lectures by SUTD staff and faculty.

## Marketing - Corinna

**Brand name**

- distinguishable
- protectable
- "searchable"

Example given - can you guess the product given the name? 
- of past student startups


**Brand essence vs. brand identity** 

- Essence 'is' vs identity 'created'.
- Identity is a manifestation of essence?

Not just and more than
- a cool logo or name 
- well-placed advertisement


**Benefits from a brand strategy**

- Differentiation
  - Why would people want to buy Seng Choon eggs and eat Japanese eggs? 


**Core Components of a brand strategy**

- Purpose. Must be functional, relevant to industry and customer needs.
- Consistency.
- Emotional Impact. What helps customers connect with you.


**Extent of consistency** 

- Environment (storefront, office, factory)
- Sales and customer office
- Print
- Website
- Content

Necessary to keep you channels harmonised - websites, Instagram, Facebook Email. Need to surround the customers with messages.


**Case Study - Argon**

- Inconsistent naming 
  - "Argon", "ARgon", "WHYRE", "argon.tech", "www.argontransform.com"
- Different handles for social media
- Company name different from product name
- Expensive at $543, but marketing material not up to standard
- Name not protectable or searchable, "Motorbike accessory"

Does not build trust. This is supposed to be a lifesaving device.

- Create a brand logo and tagline
  - Preliminiary work needed

  - Personal engagement to explain to students and parents
    - Deliver offer letter to your home



## Portable MRI - Huang Shaoying

MRI imaging. Current MRIs are bulky, which is problematic.

Proposed: low field portable MRI head imager. 

Components of a MRI
- static field, gradient (homogeneous) field, dynamic field
- fourier equation to make the image.

Different sources of a homogeous magnetic field
- Permanent magnet, Electromagnet

Various products out there that provide imaging for body part imaging

Inhomogeneous field used
- to have a relative high average field strength
- to increase the image volume
- gradient coils does not need to be simplified
- to reduce the imaging volume needed for portablility.

Progress of the idea
- successful prototype scan is done



## Microfludics - Michinao Hashimoto

Add polymers into fluids to make it a 3D-printable material.

4D printing that forms a shape upon stimuli (e.g. heat)

Microfluidics in the jelly to grow cells.

Microfluidics for subtance testing

Wearing liquids and release them under control

Motion sensors with liquids

Possible market
- Textiles (manage body temperature, monitor waist size)
- Biomedical



## Biomaterials - Fernandez & Dritsas

The problem with plastics.

Inspiration - low production energy, biodegradable

Shirllk - artificial insect skin made from industrial organic waste

"We don't aim to subsitute synthetic materials but to start a new paradigm in materials science."

Summarised - Produce anything anywhere. Regionalisation of manufacture. 

For urban environment - use urban waste. 

> Chitonous 
> - make 3D printing 20x cheaper
> - enable self-sustainable regions/countries
> - part of Earth regional ecology with human recovery/synthesis
> - first of its kind

Question asked
- What is the melting temperature of your material? There is no material.
- Cost of conversion of waste to material? In the range of commodity plastic. $1.6/kg of conversion
- Can be food safe? Yes.
- Comments on biodegradability - should designed to disintegrate quickly after a specified time, not gradually.
