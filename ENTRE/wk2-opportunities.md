# Entrepreneurship Ideas

**Sources of ideas**

- adaptation of ideas from other domains
- existing solution that is not good enough
- frustrating, random obstacles in life (Yahoo, Dropbox)
- personal hobby (Skiboards, Apple)
- dissatisfaction as consumer/user (Nike)
- travel observation (Starbucks - lack of cafe culture in US)
- from the others, close people or other entrepreneurs or researchers
- from reading - PESTLE trends, capitalise a growing trend (Hype cycle)
- research (Google, Royole) - "enter the black box of AI?"



**Mechanisms to generate ideas / creativity operators**

- Emergence / serendipity (from dreams)
- Combine (Newcomers tend to do this)
- Mutation
  - Eliminate (remove one wheel from bicycle, Sogou travel translator, TSMC only the manufacturing part of semicon)
  - Substitute (change one part out)
  - Reversal (active noise cancelling headphones, open courseware from Ivy League)
- Analogy (reasoning between similar situations) (Lidar - atmosphere to aircraft/maritime to cars, QR code - cars to anything)
- First Principles (boil things down to the fundamental truths and reason, no reason why batteries cannot be cheap)



**Class activity**

1a) Describe your venture idea
1b) Inspiration source
1c) Conception mechanism

2) One sentence mission statement that encapsulates your starting idea above (Examples: Alibaba help businesses do business, Google organise information and make it useful, Tesla accelerate world transition to sustainable energy).

3) Generate new ideas (as many as possible) that fulfil the same mission (A company needs multiple good ideas - creativity is the ability to **continually** generate novel and useful ideas)

4) List the creativity operators that lead to each of the above ideas.

5) Consciously use creativity operators to generate new ideas.

7) 6) Evaluate idea based on practicality and passion



**Insights from the screencasted interview with Elon Musk**

- self-taught, talked to a lot of people
- strong team
- passion and resilience
- charismatic
- regulatory change giving opportunity



**Factors that affect creativity**

- Intellectual abilities 
- Knowledge
- Styles of thinking - whether is it unconventional
- Personality - confidence, willingness to take risk, tolerate ambiguity
- Motivation - intrinsic interests, enjoyment, satisfaction
- Environment - support and rewards



**Greatest innovators typically**

- have mastered the basic tools and operations of the field in which they invent, but not specialised by the field
- are curious, more interested in problems than solutions
- question the assumptions made in previous work in the field
- often have the sense that all knowledge is unified, see global solutions rather than local solutions, and are generalists by nature



**Serial innovators**

- social detachment that enabled them to break with norms
- self-efficacy to overcome obstacles
- idealism that pushed them to with intensity in the face of criticism or failure
- luck

(but entrepreneurs need to work with people, same with the sciences as well)



**What are some actionable strategies to generate good ideas?**

- new ideas are transformed from existing ones
- knowledge +  creativity = ideas
(example artificial NN inspired from biology)
- read a lot (intensively and diversely) to build up your foundation
- apply cross domains



**Empathy is needed for inventions.** 

- To yourself, users and other stakeholders

- "Chindogu" - selfie stick (but that time no smartphone)

- Opinion, behaviour, beliefs, against varying degree of structure of explicitness.

  

**Ideas is not an opportunity**

Venture opportunity when the following intersect.

- Economic feasibility
- Capability
- Personal satisifcation
