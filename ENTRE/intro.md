**What is entrepreneurship?**

"The pursuit the opportunity beyond the resources that you control."
"extreme uncertainty"

Principles for making holisitic product-process-people design decision under extreme uncertain and resource constraints.


**Is entreprenuership a mindset/process?**

Many new scientific discoveries and engineering inventions make little impact on humanity (for now)

> Science, Knowledge
> Design, Invention
> Entrepreneurship, Innovation

Entreprenuership applies certain action to make the market benefit from the invention, to create social and economic impact. (Difference between invention and innovation)

We do not remember the engineers behind Apple's first computers but Steve Jobs.

Example given - Dropbox from MIT

Process is flexible and responsive to changes and results.

Entrepreneuial Process versus Administrative Process
- Orientation or Driver
- Reaction to opporutinity
- Control of resources
- Management structure
- Reward system

Entreprenuers build many things, not just the product. They also need to build product, people and process.

**Startup ecosystem in Singapore**

Singapore is ranked 10 in startup ecosystem in a ranking (the top ranking goes to Silicon Valley). Proportional of Singapore startups by  Consumer Digital (e.g Carousell). Founders of Singapore startup are mostly foreigners.

Yay we are more talented then undergrads at NYU and more talented as the undergrads in MIT.

Disadvantages in Singapore
- Low unemployment rate
- Risk-averse culture
- High cost of living, labour cost
- Lack of supply chain
- Technology specialisation (not a hub of expertise)

Origins of Silicon Valley
- first industrial park in the world
- a knowledge-based based region centred universities, rather than coal fields or ports
- encouraged students to student up companies near established companies
- Willam Shockley, uncooperative founder who recruited people from the East Coast but they left and set up their own companies in the region ending up with multiple similar companies in the region including Intel

MIT offers 33 entrepreneurship courses. Ranking of universities now include how many entrepreneurs we produce.
