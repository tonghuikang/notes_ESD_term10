# Business model

Business model is value creation and capture together.

- describes how you plan to create and capture value
- this is the way you decide to transform your ideas into economic value



### Core competency

A successful business usually is good at only one section in the business model canvas. You need to test your hypothesis - whether can you be good at the one section of the business model?

### Financial model
Assumptions need to make, given 
- Cost structure
- User behaviour

These assumptions needs to be tested (parking and lease cost is higher, higher attrition rate and lower user base growth rate)

### Pitching
How to convince VC without track record
- hard evidence that the entrepreneur has actually **sold** his products/service
- lined up **enthusiastic** potential customers, at least.

User engagement to generate evidence - Pretotypes/Products are sold immediately at partial/full price, or enthusiastically lined up to try. (e.g. C-1 car, BigBelly, Kickstarter, Dropbox)



**Frugal experienments with paying users using MVP to generate operational data about actionable metrics to obtain learning for redesign directions.**

Core of entrepreneurship - **experiement** - run with what you have, for validated learning and grounded change.



Big Belly is not just a product, there is service and software behind it.



### How to bootstrap

- Funds from personal savings, family, friends
- Apply for public grants
- Obtain payments in advance from customers
- Buy used instead of new equipment
- Borrow or lease equipment instead of buying
- Share office space and admin infrastructure
- Minimise personal expenses
- Use interns
- Negotiate for longer terms of payments from suppliers
- JIT inventory
- Targeted marketing, guerrilla marketing
- Partnering

You do not need to bootstrap if your cofounders have a strong track record. (e.g. Singapore Life insurance company raised $50m to buy backend structure from Switzerland).
