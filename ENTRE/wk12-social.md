# Social and corporate entrepreneurship

What is considered a "social entrerprise"?

"Create societal value, rather than return in business owners, investors and shareholders."
- Business that tackle social ills (examples - women's rights, public health, environment, etc)
- May conflict with the intention to maximise ROI.
- The objective of social good is embedded in the business.



**Examples of successful social entrepreneurship**

- Microloans for villagers by Grameen Bank (won Nobel Prize)
  - Repayment rate of 99.6% amd 97% of borrowers are women
  - Should not be making profit off poor people
- One laptop per children (MIT Media Lab)



**For-profit companies claiming social good**

- Zipcar, Grab for the environment
- Ant Financial (bigger than JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley combined). Wanted to provide money for the poor people because they are ignored by the bank. Offer banking accounts for everybody. 2.5% interest rate is offered to any account at any domination. Credit scores are given, of high enough you get benefits - no need to pay a deposit for example. "Bring the world equal opportunities" - but they are a money making machine.

Can, and should, for-profit companies integrate some elements of social entrepreneurship?



**Ecosystem in Singapore**

- Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs
- Singapore - RAISE - Centre for Social Entrepreneurs





Difference between

**Reasons for Corporate Entrepreneurship**
Disrupt yourself or otherwise you will be disrupted



Eight common themes of successful firms (a bias for action, close to the customers, autonomy, and entrepreneurship, productivity through people, hands-on value driven, stick to the knitting, simple form lean staff, simultaneous loose-tight properties) - however this was bad advice for companies afterwards

Reasons - disruptive technology by other companies



**Why is corporate entrepreneurship difficult?**

Complexity of company (difficult to innovate)

Management problems (resistance to innovate)

Success trap (lack of motivation to innovate)



"**Special forces**" and "**Ambidextrous organisations**"



Key takeaways (avoid success trap, sense uncertainty, think evolutionarily, keep experimenting, develop options, nurture/maintain an startup culture and ambidextrous architecture in the organisation.)
