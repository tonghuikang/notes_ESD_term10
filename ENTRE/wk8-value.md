# Value capture

**Value captured versus value created.**

- Coca cola - a lot of value captured even though not much value created
- Xerox PARC - many valuable inventions but not about to commericalise
- Apple - created and captured value (from time to time)



Entrepreneurship is about creating and capturing value. You are not merely making a prototype that is to be exhibited and thrown away. In the final pitch you need to demostrate value capture strategy.



**How to capture value**

- industry positioning
- disruptive technologies
- assets and resources
- intellectual property right
- architecture strategy
- network effects



**Industry Positioning -  Porter's five forces**

- customer, supplier, competitors, substitues, new entrants



**Disruptive technology strategy**

- cost effective
- quick-to-make
- easy-to-use market segment first
- grow and invade the mainstream market segment later



**Architecture strategy - (bottleneck)**

- consider iOS and Andriod architecture
  - Google bet that there is no significant bottleneck in the handset or the user interface.
