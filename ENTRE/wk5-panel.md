- very flexible hours, gets intro your personal
- need to detatch yourself from the company success
- you need to like what you are doing
- need to pay attention to your mental health



Minimum Viable Product

- It is smaller than you think.
- Banks expect production level products
- Found out that banks want to kill them - validation
- Persuade with time and money savings that you offer
- When is it enough to pitch to investors for money? Depends on VC.

On Singapore's startup ecosystem

- The software ecosystem is ok, but not enough software developers
- Lacking the ecosystem for hardware startup 
- Procurement of materials is difficult and slow
- The VCs are based in Singapore, less taxes incurred
- Government grants is slow
- Cryptocurrency and blockchain friendly regulations
- Government helps if you can align yourselves with them
- Good launchpad, but you need to localise to other economies
- US is a better place to scale, same with Jakarta, China too intense
- Market is too small, you need to internationalise to get VC funds
- Less willing to put money in moonshot ideas, US funds dreamers
