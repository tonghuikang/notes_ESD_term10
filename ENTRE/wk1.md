### Entrepreneuship

**What is entrepreneurship?**

"The pursuit the opportunity beyond the resources that you control."
"extreme uncertainty"

Principles for making holisitic product-process-people design decision under extreme uncertain and resource constraints.

**Is entreprenuership a mindset/process?**

Many new scientific discoveries and engineering inventions make little impact on humanity (for now)

> Science, Knowledge
> Design, Invention
> Entrepreneurship, Innovation

Entreprenuership applies certain action to make the market benefit from the invention, to create social and economic impact. (Difference between invention and innovation)

We do not remember the engineers behind Apple's first computers but Steve Jobs.

Example given - Dropbox from MIT

Process is flexible and responsive to changes and results.

Entrepreneuial Process versus Administrative Process
- Orientation or Driver
- Reaction to opporutinity
- Control of resources
- Management structure
- Reward system

Entreprenuers build many things, not just the product. They also need to build product, people and process. 


**Trends and statistics**

According to course entry survey, the pioneer batch was the most enthuisatic to become entrepreneurs.
After the course, students are less enthuisatic to become entrepreneurs, citing reasons like difficulty.

Do entrepreneurs earn more money?
- Median hourly wage is 35% less than corporate employees, controlled for experience.
- Earns $6000/month on average.

Why people want to become entrepreneurs?
- Money (greater possibility to become super-rich)
- Freedom, control and prestige
- Vision, wants to solve something


**Startup ecosystem in Singapore**

Singapore is ranked 10 in startup ecosystem in a ranking (the top ranking goes to Silicon Valley). Proportional of Singapore startups by  Consumer Digital (e.g Carousell). Founders of Singapore startup are mostly foreigners.

Yay we are more talented then undergrads at NYU and more talented as the undergrads in MIT.

Disadvantages in Singapore
- Low unemployment rate
- Risk-averse culture
- High cost of living, labour cost
- Lack of supply chain
- Technology specialisation (not a hub of expertise)

Origins of Silicon Valley
- first industrial park in the world
- a knowledge-based based region centred universities, rather than coal fields or ports
- encouraged students to student up companies near established companies
- Willam Shockley, uncooperative founder who recruited people from the East Coast but they left and set up their own companies in the region ending up with multiple similar companies in the region including Intel

MIT offers 33 entrepreneurship courses. Ranking of universities now include how many entrepreneurs we produce.

## Co-founders

**Do you need cofounders?** Depends on whether do you prefer not working alone and whether do you need resources.

According to surveyed VCs, 2/3 of the failures is due to senior management problems.

According to survery (co-)founders - Top reasons why startups fail. No market need, ran out of cash, not the right team, get outcompeted.

**Criteria for co-founders.**
How to access founding teams. **Roles. Rewards. Relationships.** Whether should you co-found a startup with friend/girlfriend/spouses/colleagues/strangers - or more generally should you co-found a company with similar people?

Relationships. Relationships makes it difficult to discuss roles and rewards which are confrontational issues. This affects the professional decision making process. Potential damage is larger.
(Asians rely on relationships more, Asians do not go to Angellist to get cofounders. Family business is probably more common here. VC do not prefer to invest in couples). However, close relationship bring together co-founders, despite the risks.

Roles. (Band manager may make good CEOs, because they bring people with different skillsets together even though). 
**Homophily**  - the tendency for people of the same characterisitic go together, but crowds out prespectives and communication.

Rewards. Equity split, because people are not compensated by salary. This signals the potential contribution of each co-founders, sets expectations and provides motivation. Revisable depending on contract. (Should the percentage of equity be based on the past performance or the future commitments?)

#### Equity split between co-founders

Most startups split equities equally, because they initially think that they are equal. However, companies that split equity - at the start, quickly, equally - have lower performance. **Equities should NOT be split equally.**

How should equity be split? What the criteria to employ? (systemic factors)
- past contribution (idea, seed money, network)
- opportunity cost (forgoing a good employment)
- future contribution commitement (difficult to anticipate)
- relationships (dynamics within the founding team)

(How much is your idea worth? Should the "idea" person but compensated for the idea? Statistically 15% premium? The idea person also tend to take a more important role, and be more committed to the role).

Challenges of splitting equity - **<u>uncertainty</u>**. The capabilities of co-founders is an unknown, future contributions are unclear, future commitment is not guaranteed. Too many unknowns. (for example - Eduardo Saverin in Facbeook)

Craft a dynamic agreement to anticipate contingencies - **<u>flexibility</u> is important!**

- Set a vesting schedule (normally 4 years) - getting 1/n-th of the total equity over n-months
- Cliff period - no equity if left or fired during the cliff period
- Set triggers, CTO getting X% based on product deliverables, sales gets revenue target
- Set aside equity until a later date/milestone

Negotiation should not be overdone as it destroys **trust**. Co-founder should not keep on emphasizing on lost opportunity (e.g. gave up 500k job). People should not only focus on their own benefit, but the interest of the company and its vision.



Week 4 - Introduce your company

Justify equity split with the following information
- Company Name
- Company Logo
- Company Vision: Single Sentence Statement
- Company Product: Short-Term
- Comapny Products: Long-Term
- Relationship of co-founders (and whether are you aware of the consequences)
- Roles: CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, Employee #1
- Rewards system: % equity or a salary for each team member
- Decision rationale for rewards system
- Team uncertainty management meaures: flexible terms, e.g. vesting schedule, cliff, trigger, etc?

Today's session - match-making - recruit or get recuited. 

Groups can consider past design projects, so that no need to build something from scratch.

3 to 5 people, maximum 6. $500 course budget.



### Conversation with prof

Group forming - idea first or group first? I don't know. 
(Personally I want to work for an idea, not for people no matter how close I am.)

Prof is interested in "**impact**" - the amount of profit or revenue earned is not really important.

He asks

- How do you **create value**? You need to make something that people want.
- How do you **capture value**? You need to make something that only you can provide.

He cited the example of the "How Old" app by Microsoft that went viral even though the model is bad. (Also, it does not really matter if the usage is sustained).
