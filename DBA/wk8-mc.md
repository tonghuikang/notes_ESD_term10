# Introduction to business

Financial statements contains three components.



### Balance sheet 

(This is a **snapshot** of the company at the **end** of the finanical period - this is **one point in time**. This is a **stock** concept.)

- **Assets**
  - Current assets
    (assets that are expected to be used up within a year)
    - Cash
    - Receivables (Accounts, Notes)
    - Inventory
    - Supplies
    - Prepaid Expenses
  - Non-current assets
    (assets that are **not** expected to be used up within a year)
    - Intangible Assets - Plant, property, equipment
    - Intangible Assets - Patents and Goodwill
- **Liability**
  - Current liabilities
    (debts that a payable within a year)
    - Payables (Accounts, Notes, Interest)
  - Non-current liabilities
    - Bonds, Loans, Mortgage, Warranty
    (debts that a payable after more than a year)
- **Equity**
  - Owners Equity
    (Initial assets provided by the owners)
  - Retained earnings 
    (In essence, this is the culumlative net income)



### Income statement

(This is a **record** of the company **over** the finanical period. This is a **flow** concept.)

- **Revenue**

- **Expenses**

  - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
    - (includes depreciation?)

  Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS

  - **Operating Expenses**
    - Sales and marketing
    - General and administrative
    - Depreciation (straight line)

  EBIT = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

  - **Interests and Taxes**

  Profit = EBIT - Interests and Taxes

- **Profit (or Net Income)**



### Cash flow statement

(This is a **record** of the company **over** the finanical period. This is a **flow** concept.)

- Cash flow from operating activities
- Cash flow from financing activities
- Cash flow from investing activities
- Net cash flow





### Analysis
Compare over space (different companies) and time.
May be normalised - in terms of sales for example.
Create a story.

**Net working capital**
= Current assets - Current Liabilities
= Inventory + account receivables - account payables
How much capital is locked up in the operations of the business.

**DuPont Identity** = Net income / total equity
= Profit Margin $\times$ Total asset turnover $\times$ Equity Multiplier
= Net income / Sales 
  $\times$ Sales / Total Assets
  $\times$ Total Assets / Total Equity
= Operating efficiency $\times$ Capital intensity $\times$ Financial leverage

##### Profitability Ratios
Gross Profit Margin
Net Profit Margin
Return on Assets
Return on Equity

##### Liquidity Ratios
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

##### Solvency Ratios
Debt-to-total-asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets
Time Interest Earned Ratio = EBIT / Interest Charges

##### Activity Ratios
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Inventory
Receivables Turnover = Sales / Accounts Receivable
Total Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets
Average Collection Period = 365 / Receivables Turnover





The accounting value of the firm is different from the market value of the firm, by the way.
