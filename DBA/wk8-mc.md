# Introduction to business

Financial statements contains three components.



### Balance sheet 

(This is a **snapshot** of the company at the **end** of the finanical period - this is **one point in time**. This is a **stock** concept.)

- **Assets**
  - Current assets
    (assets that are expected to be used up within a year)
    - Cash
    - Receivables (Accounts, Notes)
    - Inventory
    - Supplies
    - Prepaid Expenses
  - Non-current assets
    (assets that are **not** expected to be used up within a year)
    - Intangible Assets - Plant, property, equipment
    - Intangible Assets - Patents and Goodwill
- **Liability**
  - Current liabilities
    (debts that a payable within a year)
    - Payables (Accounts, Notes, Interest)
  - Non-current liabilities
    - Bonds, Loans, Mortgage, Warranty
    (debts that a payable after more than a year)
- **Equity**
  - Owners Equity
    (Initial assets provided by the owners)
  - Retained earnings 
    (In essence, this is the culumlative net income)



### Income statement

(This is a **record** of the company **over** the finanical period. This is a **flow** concept.)

- **Revenue**

- **Expenses**

  - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
    - (includes depreciation?)

  Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS

  - **Operating Expenses**
    - Sales and marketing
    - General and administrative
    - Depreciation (straight line)

  EBIT = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

  - **Interests and Taxes**

  Profit = EBIT - Interests and Taxes

- **Profit (or Net Income)**



### Cash flow statement

(This is a **record** of the company **over** the finanical period. This is a **flow** concept.)

- Cash flow from operating activities
- Cash flow from financing activities
- Cash flow from investing activities
- Net cash flow





### Analysis
Compare over space (different companies) and time.
May be normalised - in terms of sales for example.
Create a story.

**Net working capital**
= Current assets - Current Liabilities
= Inventory + account receivables - account payables
How much capital is locked up in the operations of the business.

**DuPont Identity** = Net income / total equity
= Profit Margin $\times$ Total asset turnover $\times$ Equity Multiplier
= Net income / Sales 
  $\times$ Sales / Total Assets
  $\times$ Total Assets / Total Equity
= Operating efficiency $\times$ Capital intensity $\times$ Financial leverage

##### Profitability Ratios
Gross Profit Margin
Net Profit Margin
Return on Assets
Return on Equity

The accounting value of the firm is different from the market value of the firm, by the way. There will be a different set of ratio dependent on the market value of the firm - which is the number of shares times the share price.

##### Liquidity Ratios
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

##### Solvency Ratios
Debt-to-total-asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets
Time Interest Earned Ratio = EBIT / Interest Charges

##### Activity Ratios
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Inventory
Receivables Turnover = Sales / Accounts Receivable
Total Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets
Average Collection Period = 365 / Receivables Turnover





## Cash Flow Valuation

### Concept of time value of money
Assume discount rate of 10%/year
Today's NPV of (today's \$100) is \$100
One year later's NPV of (one year later's \$100) is \$100
Today's NPV of one year later's \$110 (FV) is \$100 

All the different rates
Which 'r' to use?
APR - annualized percentage rate 
Interest rate quoted is always annualised
12% for example
Period rate 
12% / 12 months = 1%
EAR - effective annual rate
101%^12 - 100%
(given EAR calculate APR - use mathematics and calculator please)
The period rate will be used in the calculator.

### Annuity
Number of period, discount rate (per period)
PV (cash flow at start), PMT annuity, FV (cash flow at end)
You can calculate one given other 4. Either of PV, PMT and FV can be set to zero.
Variations of annuity - annuity due (at the start) or ordinary annuity (flow at the end, usually).

### Other cash flows - please use given formula.
Growing annuity (ann due or ord ann)
Perp
Growing perp

### Formulas (have some intuitive understanding first)
Annuity = C/r (1 - 1/(1+r)^t)
Perp  = C/r 
Growing Annuity = C/(r-g) [1 - ((1+g)/(1+r))^t]
Growing Perp = C/(r-g)

### Custom cash flows
Given series of cash flows
You can calculate IRR for NPV=0, NPV given discount rate
(Please take note it is begin or end)
(Please do not calculate IRR cash flow is not conventional)


### Evaluation of project suitability
(concept of difference - it is better than the next best?)
IRR
NPV
Payback
Discounted Payback
Average accounting return
Profitability index - the present value of the future cash flows divided by the initial - often proposed as a measure of performance for government or other not-for- profit investments. Also, when capital is scarce, it may make sense to allocate it to projects with the highest Pis


### Sunk cost
Please identify and ignore sunk cost.

"Financing cost are not incremental cash flows"

To be considered for cash flow, cash need to flow. Interest incurred does not mean that you pay it immediately.



### Operating Cash Flow

OCF = EBIT - Taxes + depr = Sales - costs - taxes = (sales - costs) * (1-T) + depr * T Change in NWC NCS

## Random comments

- No point spamming Coursera courses because you are competiting anyone who have access to Coursera courses - similarly no point spamming technical content as well.
- Find your value proposition (which is your LinkedIn headline?), how can you you use your interests to the betterment of the organisation.
- E-payment removes the need for cash, and keeping cash has a cost.
- Investopedia is not your friend
- Build a network before you need it
- Identify the high value, high priority task. Interns and school projects can focus on high value, low priority task. Low value, high priority task should be automated if possible.
