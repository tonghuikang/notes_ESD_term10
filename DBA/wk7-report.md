# Report and executive summary

The executive summary require segmentation of content (refer to examples three of the executive summary presented).

Most important point need to be presented first, with corresponding evidence. Then the next important point, and next evidence.



Basic report structure: 

- Title page (date, course number, client, team number, team members, advisor, project title, optional: catchy sub-title, team name) 
- Executive summary (single spaced, max: one page) 
- Body of report (double-spaced, max: 10 pages) 
- Appendices 
- Confidential appendices (to satisfy NDA)



Organization of body is up to you, guided by original (or modified) client expectations
