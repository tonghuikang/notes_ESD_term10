# Data Segmentation

- Need to summarize data to understand it 
- Percentages, Pareto sorts, and A-B-C classifications are useful with nominal categorical data (+bar charts and pie charts) 
- Mean and standard deviations are useful to summarize continuous data 
  - You can expect to find most of the observations lying within 2 standard deviations of the mean
  - 95% confidence interval, based on normal distribution, is 1.96 standard deviations above and below the mean 
- Five number summaries can also be used (box and whisker plots) 
- Try a log transformation if the data has a long tail 
- Bivariate relationships are summarized by the correlation coefficient


Which tree to select - select one that classifies at least one category perfectly.
