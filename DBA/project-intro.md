Comprehensive advice on project management is given in the slides. I probably will elaborate more when the project concludes.



Adherence to scope. You are working with a client, who may not know what they want. This is a data analysis course.  This is not a module on

- data collection (conducting survery)
- software development (making user interface)

Please alert your professors if the objectives shift.


The projects given is said to be "low priority, high value".






Additional tips of public speaking and leadership
- signals of leadership - many things
- pause when you introduce your name (more important than the title)
- the pause is the most powerful tool of speech
  - which shows that you are in control
- people want a leader, people want you to succeed
